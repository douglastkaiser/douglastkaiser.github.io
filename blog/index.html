                    <p class="lead mb-5">December 2024</p>
                    
                    <p>Throughout history, technology has shaped who holds power. The printing press shattered the church’s monopoly on knowledge. The internet broke down barriers to information and communication. Now, AI stands at a crossroads: will it follow in the footsteps of democratizing technologies, or will it become one of the most centralizing forces we’ve ever seen?</p>

                    <p>Technologies tend to either centralize or democratize power in society, driven by underlying economic and technological factors. This dynamic isn’t new—technology has always reshaped society, requiring power shifts.</p>
                        
                    <p>Some technologies inherently lead to centralization due to their fundamental characteristics. Nuclear power is a prime example: its massive economies of scale and rigorous safety requirements make only large reactors viable. This necessitates concentrated funding sources and government oversight, reinforcing centralization despite nuclear power’s benefits.</p>
                        
                    <p>Conversely, other technologies democratize power and opportunity. The combination of personal computing, the internet, and open-source software exemplifies this shift. Personal computers put computational power into the hands of individuals, breaking reliance on centralized mainframes. The internet further decentralized information sharing, enabling global communication and commerce without gatekeepers. Open-source software then accelerated this trend by making powerful tools freely available, reducing dependence on corporate-controlled ecosystems. Together, these technologies have empowered individuals, startups, and decentralized communities in ways previously unimaginable.</p>
            
                    <p>The car-versus-train comparison further illustrates this dichotomy. Automobiles democratized transportation by placing mobility directly in individuals’ hands. Trains, despite their efficiency, are inherently centralizing due to their massive infrastructure requirements, typically demanding government involvement. Both technologies provide clear benefits but differ in who controls the levers of power—either a distributed network of individuals or centralized authorities, whether governmental or corporate.</p>
            
                    <p>This brings us to one of today’s most pressing questions: what will be the impact of AI? Like any transformative technology, its effects could go either way. One scenario is highly centralized: frontier AI models requiring enormous data centers and investment, controlled by a few powerful entities, potentially displacing many workers while concentrating benefits within these hubs. The alternative is more democratic: if AI capabilities plateau at a level allowing local deployment or small-cluster operation, the benefits could be widely distributed. Open-source AI efforts could also counterbalance corporate control, ensuring more people have access to advanced AI tools.</p>
            
                    <p>However, even in a decentralized scenario, AI presents risks. Open-source AI can empower individuals, but it can also be weaponized by bad actors. AI-generated misinformation, deepfakes, and automated cyber threats could create new forms of power asymmetry, even if the technology itself is widely available. Regulation and ethical safeguards will play a crucial role in shaping whether AI becomes a truly democratizing force or merely shifts power in different ways.</p>
            
                    <p>The key question is who captures the excess capital and value generated by these technologies—whether it’s distributed among many participants or concentrated in the hands of a few central players. AI’s trajectory isn’t inevitable; it depends on the choices we make now. Will we shape its development to ensure broad access and empowerment, or will we allow it to consolidate control in the hands of a few? The future is still being written.</p>

                    <h2 class="mb-5">Dynamic Feedback Control in <span class="text-primary">Government Policy</span></h2>
                    <p class="lead mb-5">November 2024</p>

                    <p>Government policies can often be thought of as control systems, but many of them function as open-loop systems—static rules that don’t adjust based on outcomes. A clear example of this played out in India, where some states implemented policies to encourage smaller families while others did not. Over time, population shifts altered political representation, leading to unintended consequences. A more effective approach would involve designing policies with active feedback, dynamically adjusting in response to real-world conditions.</p>
                    
                    <p>Taxes provide a useful example. Instead of a fixed fee, a step up in sophistication would be to structure taxes as a percentage of income, tying them to inflation or median earnings in an area. Taking it further, taxes could be linked to overall wealth or national debt levels, creating a system that adapts to economic conditions rather than remaining rigid. Similarly, congestion pricing in New York City currently functions as a flat fee, but a more effective system would make the cost proportional to real-time congestion levels, smoothing traffic flow rather than imposing a blanket charge.</p>
                    
                    <p>Of course, dynamic policies come with potential pitfalls. A major one is opacity—if people can’t easily understand how the system works, it introduces confusion and delays in decision-making. But when implemented well, dynamic pricing mechanisms have been effective in balancing supply and demand across industries, and there’s no reason government interventions couldn’t function in a similar way.</p>
                    
                    <p>Education policy offers another compelling case. A promising liberal idea is to provide more funding to underperforming schools rather than less, ensuring that all students receive a strong baseline education. But execution is key—if funding is simply tied to poor performance without safeguards, it could create perverse incentives for schools to underperform on purpose. A well-designed system would distribute resources dynamically while preventing exploitation.</p>
                    
                    <p>Housing and zoning policies could benefit from the same approach. When housing prices spike in a city, regulatory barriers to building higher-density developments should be lowered, making it easier to meet demand. A land value tax could naturally enforce this principle by tying taxation to market value, ensuring land is used more efficiently without requiring constant intervention.</p>
                    
                    <p>This broader idea differs from policies like minimum wage being indexed to inflation. The goal is not just to adjust a number in response to past data but to create an active control loop—something akin to a PID controller—where policies continuously respond to changing conditions in real time. The next logical step would be to model this in a simulated environment. For example, a population growth model could help determine what a stable demographic pyramid looks like and how policies might adapt to medical advances, immigration trends, or economic shocks.</p>
                    
                    <p>Building such a simulation in Python, perhaps using Google Colab, could reveal fascinating insights about long-term policy stability. By treating governance as an adaptive system rather than a rigid set of rules, we could design smarter policies that evolve with society rather than lag behind it.</p>

                <div class="resume-section-content">
                    <h2 class="mb-5">Statistically Accurate <span class="text-primary">Character Generator</span></h2>
                    <p class="lead mb-5">October 2024</p>

                    <p>I want to build a character generator that produces random characters, but with the correct weighted averages for a given population and time period. The idea is that randomness should still reflect real-world demographics. If I set it to Switzerland 200 years ago and ask for three random characters of a certain socioeconomic status, it should generate three Swiss people with a roughly even gender split. Simple enough.</p>

                    <p>But things get more complicated in the modern world. If I ask for ten random Americans, I’d want the generator to reflect the actual demographics of the U.S. in a way that’s statistically sound. Maybe six of them are white, with a 50/50 gender split, two are Black, and so on. Physical characteristics should also be randomized within realistic parameters—hair color, eye color, height, body type—without falling into stereotypes or biases.</p>

                    <p>A lot of this comes from the sense that representation in media often feels off in both directions. Hollywood sometimes overrepresents minorities in ways that feel forced, while also engaging in whitewashing, especially in settings like the Midwest where nonwhite characters are often ignored despite existing in real life. The goal here isn’t to push an agenda, just to create an accurate, useful tool that authors, screenwriters, or game designers can use to generate realistic character populations.</p>

                    <p>Ideally, this could even be integrated into storytelling. Think of something like a Mad Libs system where the core plot beats are laid out first, and character details are inserted afterward. Obviously, you can’t entirely separate identity from story—people’s backgrounds influence their experiences—but for certain types of storytelling, this approach could add flexibility and depth. A big inspiration for this is D&D campaigns, where NPCs are often randomly generated but still need to fit within the world’s logic.</p>

                    <p>Beyond race and gender, the generator should also account for factors like sexual orientation. If you’re creating a random group of characters, how many of them are likely to be gay? Bisexual? The tool should make sure these elements are represented naturally and proportionally, rather than leaning on outdated assumptions or arbitrary numbers.</p>

                    <p>The end goal is an online tool that lets users generate characters who feel real, with all the diversity and statistical probability of real human populations, while still embracing the unpredictability that makes randomness interesting.</p>

                    <h3>Analyzing Human Survival Rates</h3>

                    <p>As a thought experiment inspired by Neal Stephenson's "Seveneves," I've been considering how humanity's survival chances might vary based on the warning time we receive before a planetary-scale threat. This analysis examines not just survival probabilities for different timeframes, but also how these odds might shift given our current technological capabilities and societal preparedness.</p>
                        
                    <h3>The Timeline Breakdown</h3>
                        
                    <h4>Seconds to Minutes: The Immediate Threat</h4>
                    <p>With only seconds of warning, survival chances are effectively zero. Even with minutes of notice, only a handful of VIPs near designated bunkers might survive initially, but long-term survival remains virtually impossible. The brutal reality is that such short notice essentially guarantees extinction.</p>
                        
                    <h4>Hours: The First Window of Opportunity</h4>
                    <p></p>With hours of warning, our odds improve marginally to about 0.1%. Emergency space launches become possible if vehicles like SpaceX's Dragon capsule are ready. We could potentially send emergency supplies to the International Space Station, creating a small survival pocket in orbit. While this might enable a "Dr. Stone" scenario of eventual repopulation, success would be far from guaranteed.</p>
                        
                    <h4>Days: Expanded but Chaotic Response</h4>
                    <p>At the day-scale, survival probability increases to roughly 1%. More launch vehicles could be prepared, and submarines could be retrofitted as survival vessels. However, social chaos becomes a significant factor – panic and desperate attempts to access limited bunker space could actually reduce survival chances for organized efforts.</p>
                        
                    <h4>Months: Infrastructure Adaptation</h4>
                    <p>The monthly timeframe maintains similar survival odds but opens up more sophisticated options. We could potentially convert rocket upper stages into Skylab-style habitats and better outfit existing tunnels and caves. While expanding underground infrastructure would remain challenging, multiple competing survival designs become feasible.</p>
                        
                    <h4>Years: Major Engineering Projects</h4>
                    <p>With years of warning, survival probability jumps to around 10%. This timeframe allows for new spacecraft development, bunker construction, and even lunar or Martian missions. One particularly interesting concept would be using Tunnel Boring Machines (TBMs) in a spiral pattern to create underground cities, maximizing the efficiency of continuous excavation.</p>
                        
                    <h4>Decades to Centuries: The Long View</h4>
                    <p>Longer timeframes present their own challenges. While decades of preparation could theoretically enable near-complete survival, maintaining focus and urgency becomes increasingly difficult. Political conflicts and generational differences can hinder progress, reminiscent of scenarios portrayed in "The Three-Body Problem." With centuries of warning, we might achieve 100% survival – or paradoxically, fail entirely due to human shortsightedness.</p>
                        
                    <h3>The Technology Management Perspective</h3>
                        
                    <p>Looking at this challenge through a "tech tree" lens (similar to civilization-building games) reveals interesting strategic priorities. A coordinating body might approach it as follows:</p>
                        
                    <p>Short-term: Leverage existing systems like Falcon rockets and Starlink for immediate space-based contingencies.</p>
                    
                    <p>Medium-term: Scale up TBM manufacturing to enable rapid underground development while maximizing rocket reusability for orbital infrastructure.</p>
                    
                    <p>Long-term: Develop humanoid robots for dangerous space operations and establish robust supply chains to orbital habitats.</p>
                    
                    <p>Perhaps the most sobering thought is that we might already be somewhere on this timeline without knowing it. The challenge of maintaining morale and social cohesion during such a long-term existential threat response mirrors some current debates about humanity's future – including the controversial approaches of figures like Elon Musk.</p>

                    <p class="lead mb-5">Janurary 2025</p>

                    <p>Stock prices aren't solely driven by company fundamentals and growth potential. There's an interesting demographic dynamic at play that I've been thinking about. When people are in their working years, they regularly invest portions of their income into stocks as part of their retirement planning. This creates a consistent buying pressure that pushes stock prices above what might be justified by pure financial analysis.</p>

                    <p>This isn't a controversial observation – we all know that many stocks serve as investment vehicles regardless of their underlying strength. Even companies with solid fundamentals might be trading at a premium simply because they're popular retirement account holdings. This suggests that most publicly traded stocks are likely somewhat overvalued relative to their strict financial merits.</p>

                    <p>The flip side of this phenomenon occurs when people reach retirement age. Even if a stock is performing well and represents a sound investment, retirees may need to sell to fund their living expenses. This selling pressure can artificially depress stock prices below their fundamental value.</p>

                    <p>This got me thinking: Could we use demographic data, specifically population pyramids showing the age distribution of a society, to predict whether stocks are likely to be over- or undervalued? Population pyramids are relatively stable and predictable, making them potentially useful for long-term market analysis. We occasionally see evidence of these demographic effects when stocks make significant moves in response to news that doesn't meaningfully impact their business fundamentals or industry conditions.</p>
